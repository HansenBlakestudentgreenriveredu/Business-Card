            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I’m Blake, a software engineering student at Green River College working toward my Bachelor’s in IT with a focus on software development. I’m passionate about front-end programming, and I love designing clean, responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. One of my favorite projects is a five-page website inspired by Tesla’s product lineup, complete with media queries to ensure a seamless experience across devices.

            In addition to my technical skills, I bring 5 years of professional sales experience, which has sharpened my communication, client-focused mindset, and ability to understand and solve real-world problems. I’m currently seeking an internship or entry-level opportunity in front-end development, sales engineering, or data analysis; ideally roles where I can bridge my background in sales with my passion for technology. I’m open to both in-person and remote positions.</p>
